## Specifying the Question

As an aspiring data scientist, you know that the first step in getting the right answer is asking the right question. The term "data science" is vague and ill-defined, and when someone (like you) says "I want to work in data science," or "I'm interested in ML," they could be talking about a range of differing but interconnected roles. I'll limit the discussion to four broad categories in this article:

1. **Data Scientist**: This is most likely what you're talking about when you say you want to work in data science. These are the folks responsible for **processing and exploring data, applying statistical models and algorithms, and visualizing and presenting answers to business questions.** The role requires predominantly statistical knowledge to apply models and domain knowledge to apply to business questions, with some proficiency in coding (usually a language like R or Python) to clean and process data and visualize results. Many Data Scientist roles require a graduate degree (especially with an influx of candidates from undergraduate programs in practically every other STEM field), but there are opportunities directly from an undergraduate program.
2. **Machine Learning Scientist** (or Research Scientist): If you say you want to work in ML, you're probably thinking of **designing new machine learning algorithms and researching improvements in machine learning models,** and probably publishing that research. That's the work of a Machine Learning Scientist (sometimes called a Research Scientist in industry, or a Researcher in academia). They're split between academic institutions like CMU, MIT, and Stanford, and corporate research labs like Meta AI, Google Brain, and OpenAI. They get to do the most ground-breaking, innovative work (like AlphaGo and GPT-4), and consequently have the highest barrier to entry. This type of work requires a PhD and published research, no ifs, ands, or buts.
3. **Machine Learning Engineer** (or Research Engineer): Probably the least well-known (or well-understood) of the four roles, MLEs work with their data scientist counterparts to **operationalize machine learning models and deploy systems to production.** The data scientists build the models and answer the questions (like predicting customer churn), and the MLEs turn those models into business outcomes, which can include implementing data collection and machine learning pipelines, optimizing and deploying models into production, and ensuring that models stay up to date over time. This requires a combination of software development skills (including systems knowledge) as well as an understanding of machine learning. MLE is not usually an entry-level position, and the most common route is through experience as a Software Engineer. I've included Research Engineers here as well, since their role is similar in relation to a Research Scientist.
4. **Software Engineer** (or Data Engineer): The most broadly applicable outside of data science and the role with the least data science or machine learning knowledge is software engineering. Software engineers are responsible for **designing and implementing software systems and applications.** Within data science, you're more likely to encounter Data Engineers, which are software engineers who specialize in systems that collect, store, and transform data. Unlike data scientists (or data analysts), they don't care as much about the content of the data, but more about its form, storage, and management. Data Engineers primarily need software engineering skills (data structures and algorithms; systems programming languages), knowledge of databases and data management systems, and proficiency with large-scale data processing tools and cloud platforms.

Once you understand which role interests you, you can tailor your academic program to best suit your career goals. I'll keep each of these roles in mind as I discuss the options available to you at UCLA.
