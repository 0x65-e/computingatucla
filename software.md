# Studying Software Engineering and Computer Science at UCLA

## Computer Science ≠ Software Engineering

Let's start off by clarifying that Computer Science is not synonymous with Software Engineering. It's true that most Computer Science graduates end up working in Software Engineering (and that most Software Engineers come from Computer Science programs), but CS covers so much more than SWE: hardware and computer architecture, programming languages, theory of computation, artificial intelligence and machine learning. **An undergraduate degree program in Computer Science is not a job training program for Software Engineering**. Computer Science is its own academic discipline, and software engineering is an engineering discipline that draws on many of the principles of computer science and applies an engineering methodology to design and create software under constraints.

### Software Engineering Preparation

As mentioned above, there is so much more to computer science than just software engineering, but there are some computer science topics that are useful (or even absolutely essential) for software engineers. The two most important classes, by far, are Data Structures (CS 32) and Algorithms (CS 180). These are the most frequently tested topics in software engineering interviews, and the experience you gain in CS 32 will prepare you to actually work on software in the real world. I would venture to say that these two classes alone are the bare minimum you need to actually pass a software engineering interview—although it's helpful to take additional classes.

The next most useful class is the infamous Software Construction (CS 35L), a Professor Eggert special. The class teaches the Unix shell and scripting, package management and version control, build systems, and a little bit of web programming and low-level programming. The biggest feature of the course (post-2020) is the collaborative final project, which requires you to design and build a full-stack web app using Node.js and React. If you think of CS 32 as teaching you how to write programs, you can think of CS 35L as teaching you all of the supporting processes that actually make your programs useful. You're not likely to see CS 35L topics in an interview, but knowing them will make your experience much better when you start your first software engineering internship or job. The full-stack project is also something you can show off on your resume when you don't have a lot of relevant experience to show yet.

The rest of the courses in the Computer Science department can be useful if you want to specialize in a specific area of software engineering.

* If you want to work on backend development, take Databases (CS 143)
* If you want to work on systems or anything that is performance dependent, take Operating Systems (CS 111) and Networking (CS 118)
* If you want to work on low-level programming or embedded systems, take Computer Organization (CS 33) and Computer Architecture (CS M151B)

Despite the course name, Software Engineering (CS 130) is of mixed usefulness. It teaches a lot of formal engineering processes, like requirements specification, software development methodologies, and testing. While these *can* make you a better software engineer, not every company uses the same formalisms, and it's difficult to demonstrate the qualities of a good engineer to potential employers. One benefit of the course is that, like CS 35L, there is a major course project that involves developing an application from start to finish that you can show off on your resume.
